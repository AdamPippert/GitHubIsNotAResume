==================

THIS IS NOT MY RESUME

Ok, look, I know there's this big push to make GitHub your resume.  I get it, it's supposed to be proof of all the awesome stuff that you work on to show how passionate you are about coding.  Look at all of these contributions I've made!  All the pretty functions!  It's like Facebook but for programmers!

Sorry, you're getting none of that from me.

Why not?  You're a developer, show us all of the things you've done!

For starters, I'm a full time employee and a full time student.  If I want to get any amount of sleep and/or exercise during the week, I can't be sitting here making little projects all the time.  I'll try my best to start things or update them, but frankly, I want my repositories to be quality work, and most of GitHub is not quality.  Most of the code I'm writing is proprietary, and on the job.  Much of it is also for classwork, which means it's not of much use to people in the real world.  You already have good sorting algorithms in most languages, and who wants yet another simple Hangman program in C++?

When potential employers ask me what my GitHub handle is, I will gladly give it, but PLEASE for the sake of all that is awesome about software development, do not assume that the fact that I don't have 20 projects on here means that I'm not passionate about learning and developing.  It merely means that the things I do have little utility, and high consequence, if I post them here.

Now, if you're an employer, understand I'm not trying to offend you, as I likely really want your position, and would love to be a part of your group.  That being said, it's important for you to not pass judgement on me because I haven't built the next Airbnb on GitHub.  Some of us do quality work in protected environments, and don't necessarily have the time to also half-destroy our favorite open source projects as well.  Maybe I'll get there once I graduate and you hire me.  Until then, I'm going to concentrate on developing in the environments I'm most comfortable in, doing quality work, and getting paid for it.  If I work for you, that's exactly what I'd do for you as well.
