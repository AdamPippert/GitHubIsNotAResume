GitHubIsNotAResume
==================

A GitHub is not a resume.  Some of us can't put everything we've ever worked on in the public domain, you know.

Feel free to take a look at my actual resume by downloading the "AdamPippert-Resume.tex" file, and compiling it in LaTeX.  On Linux or Cygwin, use "pdflatex AdamPippert-Resume.tex AdamPippert-Resume.pdf" to make a PDF version.

Don't have access to a UNIX machine with pdflatex installed?  Email me at adam.pippert@gmail.com, and I'll reply with the latest compiled copy.

MacOS USERS:
If you're using BasicTeX to complile a PDF of this with pdflatex (which is recommended), you will need to perform the following commands to make sure you have the appropriate fonts installed:

sudo tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended
