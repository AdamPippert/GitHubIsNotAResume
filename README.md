GitHubIsNotAResume
==================

A GitHub is not a resume.  Some of us can't put everything we've ever worked on in the public domain, you know.

Feel free to take a look at my actual resume by downloading the "Adam_Pippert_Resume.tex" file, and compiling it in LaTeX.  On Linux or Cygwin, use "pdflatex Adam_Pippert_Resume.tex Adam_Pippert_Resume.pdf" to make a PDF version.  A PDF version is included in the repository for your convenience.

MacOS USERS:
If you're using BasicTeX to complile a PDF of this with pdflatex (which is recommended), you will need to perform the following commands to make sure you have the appropriate fonts installed:

sudo tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended
